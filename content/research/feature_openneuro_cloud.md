We promote the application of cloud technology to support psychological and brain science science. Cloud technology can help scientists address bigger scientific questions and reduce mistakes. Cloud services allow error-less data analysis and management. 
 
The PESTILLI LAB has developed and operates brainlife.io, an open-source, free cloud computing platform that is allowing thousands among trainees and researchers to access the most advanced resources for data processing. brainlife.io is supported by grants from the BRAIN Initiative, the National Science Foundation, the National Institute of Health, the Department of Defense and Microsoft Corporation, and the Kavli foundation. Brainlife.io uses resources at the Texas Advanced Computing Center (TACC), the Indiana University Data Center, Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center, San Diego Supercomputer Center and Microsoft Azure.
