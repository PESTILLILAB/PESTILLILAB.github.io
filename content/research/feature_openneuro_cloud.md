We promote the application of cloud technology to support psychological and brain science science. Cloud technology can help scientists address bigger scientific questions and reduce mistakes. Cloud services allow error-less data analysis and management. The PESTILLI LAB has developed and operates brainlife.io, an open-source, free cloud computing platform that supports thousands of students and researchers with reproducible neuroimaging data processing.
