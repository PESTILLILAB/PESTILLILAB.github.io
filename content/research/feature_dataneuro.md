It has been claimed that data is the new oil.  Today, a great potential for impact and a variety of applications exist for psychological science outside the traditional domain. Data about human behavior is collected routinely on cloud platforms around the nation, often for commerce sometimes for good other times for less clear purposes. Indeed, a majority of what is commonly referred to as Data Science can be specified as Psychological Data Science. Indeed, much of what data science is applied to is understanding, classifying, and predicting human behavior, emotions, and intentions.

Discovery and understanding in psychological and brain science depend on the ability to process large amounts of data to extract meaningful insights. In addition to behavioral data, in the past ten years, the amounts of available data in psychological and brain sciences have transcended anything that it would have been possible to collect in a single laboratory. A series of collaborative, large-scale data collection and sharing projects (such as the Human Connectome Project, the Alzheimerâ€™s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative, Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development study, the Healthy Brains Network, to mention a few in the USA) have brought human neuroscience research from asking questions on a few dozens of participants to thousands of individuals. 

The PESTILLI LAB capitalizes on the recent opportunities for large-scale data analysis, data science and machine learning. The lab uses advanced data-driven methods to find unexplored associations between brain biomarkers and behavior, and to advance scientific theory and understanding.
