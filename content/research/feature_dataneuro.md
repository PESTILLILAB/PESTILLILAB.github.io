It has been claimed that data is the new oil. Discovery and understanding in psychological and brain science depend on the ability to process large amounts of "good data" to extract meaningful insights. The PESTILLI LAB capitalizes on the recent opportunities for large-scale data analysis, data science and machine learning. The lab uses advanced data-driven methods to find unexplored associations between brain biomarkers and behavior, and to advance scientific theory and understanding.
