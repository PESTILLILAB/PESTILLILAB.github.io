Vision is the primary human sense. Visual function requires coordinating the activity of multiple systems, from the eyes to the brain. Visual signals travel across long-range myelinated axonal pathways that form a network of neurons and brain areas. As of today, we understand much about the function of individual neurons and brain areas but less about communication between brain areas. The PESTILLI LAB works on understanding how neurons and brain areas connect and form networks and how these networks support human behavior. The laboratory research combines multiple neuroimaging measurements to study how networks and the biological tissue support human vision during development and across the lifespan.
