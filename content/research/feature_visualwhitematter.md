Vision is the primary human sense. Visual function requires coordinating the activity of multiple systems, from the eyes to the brain. Visual signals travel across long-range myelinated axonal pathways that form a network of neurons and brain areas. As of today, we understand much about the function of individual neurons and brain areas but less about communication between brain areas. 

The PESTILLI LAB is interested in understanding how neurons in different brain areas connect together to form networks and how these networks support human visual behavior. The laboratory research combines multiple neurobiological measurements to study how the mechanisms of these brain networks determine our vision of the world, contribute to human development and aging, and predict individualsâ€™ behavior.
