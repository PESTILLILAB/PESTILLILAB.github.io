Most humans use vision to explore the world. Clarifying how vision works is critical to understanding the brain and making progress towards disease prevention and cure. Visual function requires coordinating the activity of multiple components; the eye, cortical and subcortical brain regions. In the brain, visual signals travel across long-range myelinated axonal pathways that form an extensive network of neurons and brain areas. This myelinated network of neurons and axons is generally referred to as the ‘white matter.’ As of today, we understand more about neurons and individual brain areas but less about how areas communicate with each other. Understanding both the anatomy and organization of the long-range communication network and individual neurons and maps is key to chart the ensemble behavior of the visual system.

Importantly, human behavior is organized at multiple time scales. It takes years to acquire fluency in a non-native language, but drivers can pay attention to approaching danger in congested rush-hour freeways in a matter of milliseconds. Such a large operational range requires distinct, dedicated brain mechanisms.  Processing fast events may depend on the activity of populations of neurons within brain areas. Yet, encoding slow information processing processes such as learning and development might depend on not just the spikes and synaptic activity of neuronal populations. Changes in the cellular tissue of the white matter network supporting long-range communication might also be critical to critical events in our lifespan such as learning to read or recovering from a trauma. Mapping the human brain requires integrating measurements sensitive to signals evolving over fast and slow time scales. 

The PESTILLI LAB is interested in understanding how neurons in different brain areas connect together to form networks. The laboratory research combines multiple neurobiological measurements to study how the mechanisms of these brain networks determine our vision of the world, contribute to human development and aging, and predict individuals’ behavior.
