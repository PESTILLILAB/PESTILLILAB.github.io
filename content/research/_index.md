  subtitle: Advancing Scientific Understanding through the Integration of Theoretical and Data-Driven Methods.
  content: |
    It has been said that data are the new oil, emphasizing the value of data in driving discovery and understanding in psychological and brain science. At the PESTILLI LAB, we harness the potential of large-scale data analysis, data science, and machine learning to process vast amounts of high-quality data, extracting meaningful insights. Our lab employs advanced data-driven methods to uncover previously unexplored associations between brain biomarkers and behavior, ultimately contributing to the advancement of scientific theory and understanding.

  subtitle: Innovation and Technology for Better, Faster, Stronger Science
  content: |
    We advocate for the use of cloud technology to advance psychological and brain science. Cloud technology can enable scientists to tackle more significant scientific challenges and minimize errors. By facilitating error-free data analysis and management, cloud services can play a crucial role in ensuring the accuracy and reliability of scientific research. The PESTILLI LAB has developed and operates brainlife.io, an open-source, free-to-use cloud computing platform that supports thousands of students and researchers in conducting reproducible neuroimaging data processing.

  title: Visual White Matter and Brain Networks

  subtitle: Understanding vision is key to advancing cures and enhancing the quality of life.
  content: |
    Vision is the primary human sense, relying on the intricate coordination of multiple systems, from the eyes to the brain. Visual signals traverse long-range myelinated axonal pathways, forming a complex network of neurons and brain areas. While much is known about the function of individual neurons and brain areas, our understanding of the communication between these areas remains limited. The PESTILLI LAB focuses on uncovering how neurons and brain areas connect to form networks that support human behavior. Our research combines multiple neuroimaging measurements to study how these networks and the underlying biological tissue sustain human vision during development and across the lifespan.
