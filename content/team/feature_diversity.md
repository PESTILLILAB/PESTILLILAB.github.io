We believe that a good lab can only flourish if it embraces the ideas and backgrounds of a truly diverse set of talented people â€” of every background, race, ethnicity and life experience. We like to joke that our work has Italian design, Japanese technology and is made in America. Our PI is originally from Italy and we have a software engineer from Japan, but the rest of our lab is a diverse group of scientists as well. Our lab is a mix of genders, identities, ages, nationalities, and ethnicities, all working together to advance the understanding of the brain. Lab members and collaborators hail from the USA, Europe, South America and Asia.
