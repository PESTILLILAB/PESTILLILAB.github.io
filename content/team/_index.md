  subtitle: |
    It takes the world to understand the brain, and the world is a village rich with people of different backgrounds.
  content: |
    We believe that a good lab can only flourish if it embraces the ideas and backgrounds of a truly diverse set of talented people — of every background, race, ethnicity and life experience. We like to joke that our work has Italian design, Japanese technology and is made in America. Our PI is originally from Italy and we have a software engineer from Japan, but the rest of our lab is a diverse group of scientists as well. Our lab is a mix of genders, identities, ages, nationalities, and ethnicities, all working together to advance the understanding of the brain. Lab members and collaborators hail from the USA, Europe, South America and Asia.

    Inclusion means open access to resources and a safe place for all
  content: |
    We are committed to make educational and computational resources available to everyone that is interested in neuroscience, including communities that would otherwise not have access to these resources. Using data, analyses, and tutorials available on brainlife.io, we can teach neuroscience at institutions that do not have a neuroscience program. For instance, our brainlife.io team is developing a project in collaboration with Lawrence Technological University (LTU) to connect minority-serving institutions with neuroscience data and advanced computing resources. This project will leverage brainlife.io to democratize neuroscience education bringing brain understanding closer to individuals with less privileged access to data, tools and knowledge.
